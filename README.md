Inect00r is a simple script to test some of my golang skills, since i am quite new to go i decided why not make all my python scripts golang, this is a script to test a url's inject-abilities 

# what can it do EX options 
well this script is very basic, it can 
. test inject urls through defualt lists 
. test inject urls through custome lists
. use tor sockets to connect and tunnel to the client 
. table out the data of the injectable url
